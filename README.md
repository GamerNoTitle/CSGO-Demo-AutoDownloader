## What's this

This tool can help you download your CSGO demo after you play the game, and save it in `Demo` folder.

## Getting Started

### Fill the config

When you download the pack from RELEASE page (or clone the source code), you got a `config.json`. Now I am going to tell you the detailed information of the varibles

```json
{
    "delay": 3600,
    "sessionid": "",
    "steamid64": 0,
    "steamcustomid": "",
    "steamcookie": "",
    "previousdownload": true,
    "proxies": {
        "http": "",
        "https": ""
    }
}
```
